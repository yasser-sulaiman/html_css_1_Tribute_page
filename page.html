                    Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur and business magnate.
                    He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor,[note 2] CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.;
                    founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI.
                    A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world.
                    Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa.
                    He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University.
                    He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics.
                    He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career,
                    co-founding the web software company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999.
                    Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.
                    The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
                    In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and CTO.
                    In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc.
                    (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008.
                    In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy.
                    In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence.
                    In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces,
                    and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop,
                    a high-speed vactrain transportation system.
                    Musk has been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies.
                    In 2018, he was sued for defamation by a British caver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue;
                    a California jury ruled in favor of Musk. In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
                    for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla.
                    He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage.
                    Musk has spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for his other views
                    on such matters as artificial intelligence and public transport.

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[4] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman),
            a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[5][6][7] but raised in South Africa.
            His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer.[8]
            Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[7][9]
            His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian,[10][11] and Musk has British and Pennsylvania
            Dutch ancestry.[12][13] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere,[12]
            a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[14] Musk has become estranged from his father,
            whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."[14]
            He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[10][15]
            Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20.
            [16][17] He learned computer programming using a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created 
            called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[18][19] An awkward and introverted child,[20]
            Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.
            [14][21] He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria 
            Boys High School.[22]

            Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[23] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his
            Canadian-born mother.[24][25] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; 
            this allowed Musk to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.[26] 
            Arriving in Canada in June 1989, Musk failed to locate a great-uncle in Montreal and instead stayed at a youth hostel. 
            He then traveled west to live with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan.[27] He stayed there for a year, working odd jobs at a 
            farm and lumber-mill.[28] In 1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[29][30] 
            Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree 
            in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.[31][32][33]
            In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research 
            Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket 
            Science Games.[34] In 1995, Musk was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford 
            University in California.[35] Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries.[24] 
            He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.[36]

            In 1995, Musk, Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds from angel investors.[14] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.[37] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.[38] Musk says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and instead rented an office and slept on the couch and showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother. According to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time."[37] The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[39] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[40] Musk's attempts to become CEO, a position held by its Chairman Rich Sorkin,[41] were thwarted by the board.[42] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999.[43][44] Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.

            In 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain, assigning a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[156] On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[157] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[158] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area at an estimated total cost of $6 billion.[159] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[160]
            In June 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company started a tunnel project with Hawthorne airport as its destination.[161] In July 2017, Musk claimed that he had received "verbal government approval" to build a hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., stopping in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[162] Mention of the project for the DC to Baltimore part were removed from the Boring Company website later in 2021.[163]
